        <h2>Aroids</h2>
        <h3>What the heck is an aroid anyway?</h3>
        <!--aroid overview-->
        <div class = "plant_overview">
          <p>To be honest, I don't really know.</p>
          <p>I looked it up and saw a whole bunch of different explanations. One said something about the shape of the leaves, one said something about rooting in water, others said different things entirely,
          so I really don't know. Essentially, aroids are an overarching family of plants that are extremely adaptable to many conditions. Many common houseplant species, such
          as pothos, monsteras, alocasias, etc, are aroids.</p>
          <p>Because aroids are so adaptable, most of them make excellent houseplants, especially for beginners. They are pretty tolerant to low light (all plants will do better with at least some sunlight, but these can tolerate having less).
          They also aren't super picky about humidty, and they prefer to dry out between waterings so they often make a great first plant to care for.</p>
          <p>One plant genus I always recommend to beginners is Pothos (pothos are probably my favorite plants). There a ton of different kinds of pothos,
          so there definitely is one that will suit anyone's interests, they often grow pretty fast, so they have a good effort-to-output ratio, and they're basically impossible to kill.</p>

        <h3>Golden Pothos</h3>
        <p>Okay. I know that I just said these are impossible to kill, but I have accidentally almost killed this poor guy at least 3 times. Of all my pothos, this one is probably my least favorite.
        It just doesn't really grow at all, and the leaf pattern just isn't my favorite. Maybe if it starts to vine I'll enjoy it more, but we'll see.</p>

        <h3>Marble Queen Pothos</h3>
        <p>This plant is sometimes the only thing that keeps me going. This was the very first plant that I ever got, and now she's like 3 feet long and so much of my emotional stability is connected with her. Her name is Queenie, and she's beautiful.</p>

        <h3>Neon Pothos</h3>
        <p>I've had a tricky relationship with this guy. I got him in September of 2020 and for a few months, it just didn't really grow at all. I eventually realized that the soil he's potted in is super chunky and well-draining, so I started watering it more frequently and now he's growing like crazy.</p>

        <h3>Jade Pothos</h3>
        <p>I bought this plant for my mom for Christmas from a cheap, semi-sketchy website and it came half-dead, completely rootbound, and infested with grubs.
          I decided to split the plant in two, and I gave my mom one half and kept the other half and it's growing like a monster and I love it.</p>

        <h3>Heart Leaf Philodendron</h3>
        <p>I'd never had a philodendron before this one, and I'm still having a hard time figuring out how it grows. I still like it, but it's definitely not my favorite. This is definitely an indestructable plant that
        I recommend to anyone who wants a houseplant that will vine eventually.</p>

        <h3>Alocasia Polly</h3>
        <p>This plant is destroying me. I love how this plant looks. I named her El because she looks like the Stranger Thing's monster's head
            (and this plant is also called Elephant's Ear Alocasia), however she is definitely in the process of
            dying. Alocasias tend to have a "one in one out" policy - if they're putting out a new leaf, an older one is probably gonna die,
            but mine is losing a leaf every other day and no new ones have come in.</p>
