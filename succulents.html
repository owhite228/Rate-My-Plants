        <h2>Succulents</h2>
        <h3>Let's have a chat about succulents</h3>
        <div class = "plant_overview">
          <p>First of all, what even are they?</p>
          <p>Succulents are plants that store water in their leaves, which makes their leaves extremely waxy and thick. Because of this, they're able to
          thrive on limited water and they're often found in deserts.</p>
          <p>People always recommend succulents as a beginner plant, but controversal opinion: succulents are deceptively hard. <br>
          They are harder to kill than other plants, but for them to grow, they really need the absolute perfect conditions, so they can
          sometimes be unsatisfying to have. <br>
          I personally love fast-growing plants -- or at least grow in a way that I can observe, and most succulents really don't do that. They grow really slowly.</p>

          <h2>Rating my Succulents</h2>
          <h3>Crassula Ovata (aka the Jade Plant)</h3>
          <p>This is one of the first plants I got, because everyone said it's a great plant for beginners. Don't ask me if it's grown at all bc I have no idea.</p>

          <h3>Hoya Obovata</h3>
          <p>Despite everything I said about succulents, this was definitely a wishlist plant for me for ages and I love it a lot (it does grow extremely slow, but moving it to a spot
            where it gets direct sun has helped).</p>

        <h3>String of Pearls</h3>
        <p>Again, despite my earlier defamation of succulents, I love this plant so much. I have two of them, and they grow so fast
          (maybe that's why I like it so much). The leaves looks like little peas on a vine which is hilarious and I want ten more.</p>

          <h3>Hope Peperomia</h3>
          <p>Peperomias are an extremely popular type of plant, and they're especially big with plant collectors because there are a lot of different varietes, but honestly,
          I'm just not super into them. I am very attached to this particular plant though, because I got it from a Star Market and someone had trimmed the branches (borderline criminal),
          and then it started to put out little sprouts from where it was cut and I cried a lot about it and now it's huge.</p>
