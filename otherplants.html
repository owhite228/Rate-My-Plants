        <div class = "plant_overview">
          <p>The thing about taking care of houseplants is that, because they're living things, there isn't any one way to perfectly take care of a plant
          no matter where in the world you are. Taking care of plants is a learning process of figuring out the 'biome' of your house and tailoring it to
          suit the needs of each plant, and that's where it's great to do research and try new things. Plants are resiliant and they want to be alive. They'll
          recover if you make a few wrong choices about their care.</p>
          <p>I'm definitely not a plant expert. This really is just a hobby that has gotten a little bit out of control. These are some of my
            plants that don't really fit into any of the other categories (or maybe they do and I just don't know) </p>

        <h3>Pilea Peperomioide (aka Chinese Money Plant)</h3>
        <p>I'm gonna be very real. I beheaded this plant while trying to propogate it. I managed to save it and now it's (thankfully) growing really well, but
        it definitely was a trying time. This plant does grow super fast and looks really interesting and different, so it's a fun plant to add to the collection.</p>

        <h3>Ficus Elastica 'Ruby' (aka Ruby Rubber Plant)</h3>
        <p>This plant is beautiful. It'll get big someday hopefully. It grows semi-slow and there's so much contradictory care information, so I'm not
        completely sure if I'm caring for it properly, but it's probably fine.</p>

        <h3>Ficus Elastica 'Tineke' (aka Variegated Rubber Plant)</h3>
        <p>This plant is...confusing. It's another one that I bought from that sketchy website, and it doesn't look like how it's supposed to. I'm not sure if it's just a baby or
        if it's another plant entirely? It's cute though, I guess.</p>

        <h3>Fiddle Leaf Fig</h3>
        <p>Okay let's dive into the fiddle leaf fig. This is a very popular one that's labeled as either SUPER easy or SUPER hard to care for. I wasn't even going to get one
        because they're usually super expensive (because they're trendy), but I found one at Stop and Shop for 15 dollars. I've been keeping this one in a corner of my room
        that gets literally no light and it's been doing okay, and the only weird thing it's done in the past is push out new leaves plagued with edema (weird red spots that disappear eventually),
        but once I stopped slacking with watering it, it stopped doing that.</p>
        <h4>Rating: 7/10, but keep in mind this one has a reputation for being a diva, and some people have had a hard time with it.</h4>

         <h3>Tradescantia 'Nanouk' (aka Wandering Dude)</h3>
         <p>I love this plant so much! It has a beautiful pattern on the top of the leaf, and the underside is bright magenta and it's so cute, and I named him Ken...
           however. I was under the impression that this is an easy plant that you can semi-neglect and you cannot. It needs regular watering, so when I accidently didn't water it for a few days it was not happy, and it lost some leaves.
         I've been on my A-game with watering since then and even though it's been about 3 weeks, it still hasn't completely recovered.</p>

         <p>I feel nothing for this plant. It's super boring and it grows really slow. I regret buying it.</p>
