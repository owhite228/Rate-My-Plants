        <h2>Marantaceae</h2>
        <h3>What exactly is a marantaceae?</h3>
        <!--marantaceae overview-->
        <div class = "plant_overview">
          <p>Marantaceae is a family of plants that encompasses many different species, including Calatheas, Marantas, Stromanthes, and Ctenanthes.</p>
          <p>These plants are more commonly referred to as 'prayer plants' because at night they lift their leaves and lower them in the morning. It's very cute.</p>
          <p>In my experience, these guys are a little (read: a lot) needier than other plants, (especially calatheas). Prayer plants are definitely not at the top of my list when
            I'm recommending plants to a beginner. They need a LOT of humidity to be happy - that's probably the biggest deal for these plants,
            and if they're getting enough humidity, they may not be as picky about other things such as watering or sunlight (but that's just in my experience).</p>
          <p>What they lack in simplicity that make up in their beauty. The most beautiful plants I've ever seen are usually prayer plants.</p>

        <h3>Calathea Vittata</h3>
        <p>Ok people rag on Calatheas because they are total divas, but this one is doing great. She doesn't grow a ton, but that's okay.</p>
        <h4>Rating: 7/10</h4>

        <h3>Calathea Beauty Star</h3>
        <p>Another healthy Calathea. These leaves are so pretty I cannot believe nature created this on its own. I've heard that this is the most easy-going
        calathea, and in my experience that's been true, so if you've done really well with some easier plants and want to dive into something a little more challenging,
        I'd probably recommend this one.</p>

        <h3>Calathea White Fusion</h3>
        <p>Yes I caved and got another one. I killed one of these in the fall. It was very tragic.</p>
        <h4>Rating: 10/10 (to appease the plant gods - realistically it's probably a 4/10 - don't get it unless you're prepared to suffer)</h4>

        <h3>Maranta Red</h3>
        <p>This is one of the first plants I got and she's doing amazing. She's even putting a flower out currently, and I feel so honored.<br>
          (houseplants don't bloom very often, and when they do it means that the conditions in your house are perfect, so it's a big deal when it happens)</p>

        <p>This was my number 1 wishlist plant for months, and I found it at a tiny florist shop by the Symphony t-stop and I just about died.</p>

        <h3>Stromanthe Triostar</h3>
        <p>I've stressed out so much about this plant, but I think the winter was hard on it. Most of it's leaves got crispy and brown around February, but
        now it's putting out a ton of new growth and it looks really healthy. The leaves on this one are also stunning</p>
